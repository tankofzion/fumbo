# Smart contract wallet example

## Introduction

Frankly, unless being crypto-savvy, private keys and crypto-wallets suck! A major effort of simplification must be undertaken 
for crypto-technologies to get a massive adoption. In this example, we suggest moving wallets and accounts to layer-2 so 
that to ease users' life.

For doing so, we simplify wallet usage using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) techniques?
