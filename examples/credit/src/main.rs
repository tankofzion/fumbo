//! Decentralized autonomous credit scoring organization
//!
//! ## Introduction
//!
//! Rather than relying on central [credit bureaus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbureau.asp)
//! (like  Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, in United States) to collect and synthesize information
//! regarding credit risk for lending institutions, a decentralized approach can be considered, that
//! could leverage on collaborative proof systems and multi-party computation techniques
//! (Alex **OZDEMIR** and Dan **BONEH**, February 22, 2022) so that to build a **decentralized
//! autonomous credit scoring organization**.
