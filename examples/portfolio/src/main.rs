//!
//! ## Introduction
//!
//! In this example, the [net asset value (or NAV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp) of
//! a portfolio is calculated.
//! Remember that in a zero-knowledge proof, a prover wants to convince a verifier that some public
//! statement is true. However, the proof of this statement holds sensitive details that canâ€™t be
//! shared.
